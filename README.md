# Five Platonic Solids

To prove that there are exactly 5 Platonic solids, we can follow a step-by-step process, based on the definition of a Platonic solid and using some basic geometric principles.

## Definition of a Platonic Solid:
A Platonic solid is a convex polyhedron with the following properties:
1. All faces are congruent regular polygons.
2. The same number of faces meet at each vertex.
3. The same number of edges meet at each vertex.

## Steps to Prove There Are Exactly 5 Platonic Solids:

### 1. Euler's Formula for Polyhedra:
Euler's formula for polyhedra is given by:

`V - E + F = 2`

where `V` is the number of vertices, `E` is the number of edges, and `F` is the number of faces. Euler's formula is true for any polyhedron.

### 2. Relationships between `V, E, F, p,` and `q`:
- Let `p` be the number of edges at any vertex.
- Let `q` be the number of sides in the regular polygon that makes up the polyhedron.
- For any Platonic solid, at each vertex, `p` edges meet.
- Therefore, we may conclude that `E = Vp`. However, since each edge is shared by two vertices, this counts each edge twice. Thus, we have:

`E = Vp / 2`

- Similarly, for the relationship between `F, q,` and `E`:
  - For any Platonic solid, `q` is the number of sides (or edges) in each face.
  - Therefore, `E = Fq`. Again, since each edge is shared by two faces, this counts each edge twice. Thus, we have:

`E = Fq / 2`

### 3. Combining Formulas (`V - E + F = 2`, `E = Vp / 2`, and `E = Fq / 2`):
- Solving `E = Vp / 2` for `V`:

`V = 2E / p`

- Solving `E = Fq / 2` for `F`:

`F = 2E / q`

- Substituting these values into `V - E + F = 2`:

`(2E / p) - E + (2E / q) = 2`

- Dividing through by `2E`:

`(1 / p) - (1 / 2) + (1 / q) = 1 / E`

- Adding `1 / 2` to both sides:

`(1 / p) + (1 / q) = (1 / 2) + (1 / E)`

### 4. Investigation of the Equation `(1 / p) + (1 / q) = (1 / 2) + (1 / E)`:
- Note that this equation must hold for any Platonic solid.
- Since `E >= 3` for any polyhedron, `1 / E > 0`.
- Therefore:

`(1 / p) + (1 / q) > 1 / 2`

### 5. Investigation of the Inequality `(1 / p) + (1 / q) > 1 / 2`:
- This inequality must hold for any Platonic solid.
- Since `p >= 3` and `q >= 3`:
  - `p = 3`, `q = 3`:

    `(1 / 3) + (1 / 3) > 1 / 2` (true, so this is a Platonic solid)

  - `p = 4`, `q = 3`:

    `(1 / 4) + (1 / 3) > 1 / 2` (true, so this is a Platonic solid)

  - `p = 5`, `q = 3`:

    `(1 / 5) + (1 / 3) > 1 / 2` (true, so this is a Platonic solid)

  - `p = 6`, `q = 3`:

    `(1 / 6) + (1 / 3) = 1 / 2` (false, so this is not a Platonic solid)

  - `p = 3`, `q = 4`:

    `(1 / 3) + (1 / 4) > 1 / 2` (true, so this is a Platonic solid)

  - `p = 3`, `q = 5`:

    `(1 / 3) + (1 / 5) > 1 / 2` (true, so this is a Platonic solid)

### 6. There Are Only Five Possible Value Combinations of `p` and `q`:
- From the analysis above, there are only 5 possible combinations for `p` and `q`, corresponding to the 5 Platonic solids:
  - `p = 3`, `q = 3`: Tetrahedron
  - `p = 4`, `q = 3`: Octahedron
  - `p = 5`, `q = 3`: Icosahedron
  - `p = 3`, `q = 4`: Cube
  - `p = 3`, `q = 5`: Dodecahedron
